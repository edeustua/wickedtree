# wickedtree - A Recursive Wick's Theorem Implementation
wickedtree is a simple implementation of Wick's theorem exploiting a binary tree.
The approach is based on "traveling" with creation operators, recursively,
from right to left, such that a binary tree is constructed containing all
possible contractions of a many-body expression.

The purpose of this project is to produce a simple and pedagogical code,
allowing for simple calculations of time-independent many-body expressions in
quantum chemistry. It is not meant to be a computationally performant code.
